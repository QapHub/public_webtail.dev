# WebTail

[WebTail](https://webtail.dev) is a lightweight, browser-based log viewer and tailing tool.  
It’s designed as a quick alternative to **WinTail**, PowerShell / Bash tail commands, or other CLI log monitors.

## Features
- View log files in real time directly in your browser  
- Works offline — just open the HTML file locally  
- No dependencies, no installation, no backend required  
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
- Portable and simple — only three files needed

## Installation / Setup
1. Download or clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QapHub/public_webtail.dev.git
   ```

2. Copy these three files into any folder:  
   - `index.html`  
   - `styles.css`  
   - `app.js`

3. Open `index.html` in **any modern browser**  
   ⚠️ Firefox is currently unsupported.

## Usage
- Open `index.html`  
- Select a log file from your local machine  
- The tool will display updates as the file grows (similar to `tail -f`)
